To scan images pixel by pixel:
    3 main methods:
        1. C-style  --> efficient
        2. Iterator --> easy and safe
        3. On-the-fly --> meant for random pixel access

A built-in function for complete look-up table transformations: LUT
    void LUT(original, lookup-table, new);

To apply a mask (or kernel) to an image:
    2 main methods:
        1. The basic method --> manual approach
        2. filter2D --> built-in, fast, easy
    void filter2D(originalMat, outputMat, depth, kernel);

To linearly blend two images:
    alpha = value between 0 - 1
    beta = (1.0 - alpha);
    void addWeighted(image1, alpha, image2, beta, 0.0, newImage);

To adjust the brightness or contrast:
    - alpha is the gain and is used to adjust contrast
    - beta is the bias and is used to adjust brightness
    void imageMat.convertTo(new_imageMat, -1, alpha, beta);
